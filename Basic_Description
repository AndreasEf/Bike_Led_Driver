The aim of this project was to create an efficient driver for a high power led.
The brain of the circuit is a PIC16F18313 from Microchip. The basic advantage it
gives us is the PPS functionality, allowing us to map the input and/or output of 
some peripherals. Furthermore it 's an XLP device which means that the power consumption
is minimal. To power the circuit we use Maxim's MAX1797 DC-DC converter. The chip 
contains many features but i will refer only some basics. We can use any source or a
single cell battery in a range of 0.85V to 5V. The MAX1797 contains an on-chip comparator
for low-battery shutdown. I added a jumper(JP3) as the low-battery voltage selector. 
In position 1 the threshold is 0.85V(e.g. Alkaline Batteries) and in position 2 the 
threshold is 2.7V(e.g. Lithium Batteries). The input is protected from an overvoltage
event with a reverse polarized zener diode. Furthermore, the battery voltage is monitored
with an ADC channel of the microcontroller. The LED can be powered directly from the 
battery or from the DC-DC converter(JP5). To set the brightness of the led we use a
PWM channel of the microcontroller. The PWD controls a mosfet driver(UCC27511) from 
Texas Instruments.
