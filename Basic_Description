The aim of this project was to create an efficient driver for a high power led.
The heart of the circuit is a PIC16F18313 from Microchip. The basic advantage it
gives us is the PPS functionality, allowing us to map the input and/or output of 
some digital peripherals. Furthermore its an XLP device which means that the power
consumption is minimal.
