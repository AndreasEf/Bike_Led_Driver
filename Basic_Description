The aim of this project was to create an efficient driver for a high power led.
The heart of the circuit is a PIC16F18313 from Microchip. The basic advantage it
gives us is the PPS functionality, allowing us to map the input and/or output of 
some digital peripherals. Furthermore its an XLP device which means that the power
consumption is minimal.
To power the circuit(and the led if we want(look at JP5)) we use a MAX1797 DC-DC converter.
We can use any single cell battery in a range of 0.85V to 5V. The MAX1797 contains an 
on-chip comparator for low-battery shutdown. I added a jumper(JP5) as the low-battery 
voltage selector. In position 1 the thresholt is 0.85V(e.g. Alkaline Batteries) and in
position 2 the threshold is 2.7V(e.g. Lithium Batteries). The input is protected from 
an overvoltage event with a reverse polarized zener diode.
