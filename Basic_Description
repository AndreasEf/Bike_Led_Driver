The aim of this project was to create an efficient driver for a high power led.
The heart of the circuit is a PIC16F18313 from Microchip. The basic advantage it
gives us is the PPS functionality, allowing us to map the input and/or output of 
some peripherals. Furthermore it 's an XLP device which means that the power consumption
is minimal. To power the circuit(and the led if we want(JP5)) we use a MAX1797 DC-DC 
converter. We can use any single cell battery in a range of 0.85V to 5V. The MAX1797 
contains an on-chip comparator for low-battery shutdown. I added a jumper(JP5) as the 
low-battery voltage selector. In position 1 the threshold is 0.85V(e.g. Alkaline Batteries) 
and in position 2 the threshold is 2.7V(e.g. Lithium Batteries). The input is protected from 
an overvoltage event with a reverse polarized zener diode. Furthermore, the battery 
voltage is monitored with an ADC channel of the microcontroller.
